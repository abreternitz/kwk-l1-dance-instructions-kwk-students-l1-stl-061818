# Upper Body

# ##### Bob the reins

# 1. Holding your arms out in front of you, straight and at chest level
# 2. Cross your right wrist over your left and hold them together
# 3. Lift your arms up and down in a loose bouncing movement, in time with the beat of the song. This movement is repeated **eight** times.

# **Lasso**

# 1. Start arm movement by holding left arm so the back of your wrist is near your chin, pointing your left elbow straight left.
#   - Lift right arm up and point right elbow diagonally to the right.
#   - Raise right forearm so that it points straight up, and **whip it in small circles** to the beat of the song, as if you were a cowboy holding a rope lasso. This movement is repeated **eight** times as well.



# #### **Bust a move:**

# - Be cool
# - Be snazzy!
